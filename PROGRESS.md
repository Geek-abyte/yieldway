## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
1. ✅ **Development Environment**: RESOLVED - All tools installed and working
2. ✅ **Soroswap API**: RESOLVED - Staging API configured with proper endpoints and auth
3. ✅ **Staging API Testing**: RESOLVED - All endpoints verified and working (28 pools, 3 tokens)
4. **Contract Implementation**: Need to implement actual deposit/withdraw logic with staging API
5. **DeFindex Integration**: Need to research DeFindex testnet integration

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ **Time Management**: Parallel development tracks established
- ✅ **Testnet Dependencies**: Multiple RPC endpoints configured
- ✅ **Integration Complexity**: Phase-by-phase validation planned
